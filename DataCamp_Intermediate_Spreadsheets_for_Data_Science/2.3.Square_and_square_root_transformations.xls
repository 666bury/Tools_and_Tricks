There are many more mathematical transformations that you can apply to your data. In fact, it's possible to create very complex transformations by building them step-by-step.

Asteroids have roughly elliptical orbit around the sun, and ellipses have a property called a focus point. In order to calculate this point, you'll need to know about another type of transform, the square root.

    SQRT() calculates the square root of a number.

TASK
In column H, calculate the square of the aphelion in column F.
In column I, calculate the square of the perihelion in column G.
In column J, calculate the difference between these two numbers.
In column K, calculate the square root of the difference.
