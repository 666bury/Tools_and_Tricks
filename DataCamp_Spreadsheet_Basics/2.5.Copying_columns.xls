In this last exercise about copying cells, you'll copy columns of references all at once!

To do this, you first need to select a column of cells instead of just one. Then move your mouse to the lower right corner until you see the "+"-sign, click and drag towards where you want to copy:

TASK
Start by filling in a reference to B2 in D2. Make sure to start the formula with a =.
Copy D2 down to D11 vertically by dragging it downwards.
Make sure D2:D11 is selected, copy this column one to the right to E2:E11. Have a look at the values in the new range.
