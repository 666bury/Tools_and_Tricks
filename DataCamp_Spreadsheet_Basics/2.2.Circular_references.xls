As you saw in the previous exercise, when a referenced cell changed its value, the referencing cells update instantly.

But what happens when the referencing cell and the referenced cell are the same? In other words, what happens if a cell references itself?

In fact, this is called a circular reference: a cell that directly, or via a chain of other references, refers to itself. The following diagram illustrates 3 cases of circular references
Google Sheets won't know how to deal with this by default, as it doesn't find a value to fill in. A #REF! error, or reference error, will appear.

TASK
In D2, change the value of the reference so the cell references to itself. You should see a #REF! error appear.
You'll see that E2 currently refers to C2, and C2 holds a value. Now replace the value in C2 by a reference to E2. This way C2 references E2, which references C2, and so on. What do you see?
