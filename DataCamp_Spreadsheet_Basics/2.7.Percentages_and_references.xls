You can use references in any kind of calculations that you saw in the previous chapter.

For example, you can take percentages of values you refer to. If A1 has the value 200 and you fill in = A1 * 1% in another cell, it will result in 2.

You are not limited to use 1 reference, you can do calculations with multiple references as well. For example, if A1 holds 2 and B1 holds 3, = A1 * B1 will be equal to 6.


TASK
In D2:D11, fill in the growth of the population in the past year. You can assume that in each country, the population grew by 1.12% - which is the global growth rate. Use those copy skills to speed up the process.
In E2:E11, fill in the population density of each country. You find the density by dividing the population numbers in column B by the land area.
