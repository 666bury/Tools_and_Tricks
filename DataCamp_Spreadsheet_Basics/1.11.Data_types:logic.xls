In the last exercise of this chapter, you'll see one more data type: logical.

Actually, you've seen this data type before, when we used comparison operators. A logical cell can have two values: TRUE or FALSE. Logical cells will be aligned in the center. They can be used to express whether certain conditions are true or false.

When you enter true or false in a cell, it's also recognized as a logical. Logicals are case insensitive, but Google Sheets will replace the value you entered by the capitalized logical: TRUE or FALSE.

TASK
In F2, fill in the value true. It shouldn't be a formula, so don't prepend the value by =. If you've used lower case letters (true), watch as Google Sheets replaces the value by the capitalized TRUE once you hit enter.
Recall the comparison operators? You can use logicals in some of these as well. In F3, check whether TRUE is not equal to FALSE. It's a formula, so prepend it by =. You'll have to use the <> operator.
