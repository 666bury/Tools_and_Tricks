In this chapter we've covered the following concepts:

relative references: references to values in cells, e.g. A1. The value changes when the referred cell changes.
copying cells: dragging formulas to other cells will shift the relative references
calculations with references: references can be used in calculations as if they were the value they refer to
absolute references: references with columns and/or rows locked, e.g. $A$1. They don't change when copied.
It's time to put all your referencing skills to work in the final exercise of this chapter.

TASK
Fill in D2:D12 with the amount by which the population will grow. Use the growth index in B14.
Fill in the population density in E2:E12. This is the population per square kilometer.
Fill in the density growth in F2:F12, which is the growth per square kilometer.
Change the growth to 2.00% and watch the changes ripple through.
