It's time to set your referencing skills to good use. In the following exercises you'll see how to do calculations with references.

You might wonder how Google Sheets calculates something like = A1 + 1. It might feel a bit weird to do mathematical operations on something that's not a number, like a reference. In fact, in this example Google Sheets will just take the value in A1, and add 1 to it. If A1 has the value of 3, for example, = A1 + 1 will be 4.

If you've taken a DataCamp course on python or R before, this is similar to how variables work there.

TASK
Fill in the land area of China in miles in D2. To convert square kilometers to square miles, divide the values by 2.59. Use a reference to C2.
Use the copying technique you learned in the previous exercises to fill down the square miles in D2:D11.
