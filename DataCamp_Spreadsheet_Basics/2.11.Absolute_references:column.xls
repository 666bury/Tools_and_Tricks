In other cases, it can be useful to make a reference where the column reference is absolute and the row reference is relative. In the New York City streets analogy, this would be all houses on a particular avenue running from north to south.

We keep the column constant by prepending only the column by a $, for example $A1.

TASK
Fill in F2:F11, the population density per square mile. Try to do this first by selecting column E2:E11, and copying it one column to the right by dragging from the lower right corner.
Again, copying these values doesn't give the expected values. You can solve this by locking only the population column (B) in E2:E11 and repeating the copying process. Try this now!
