A reference can be partially absolute, where only the column or the row is absolute. Sometimes it can be useful to make a reference where the row reference is absolute and the column reference is relative.

In the New York City streets analogy you saw in the previous exercise, this would be all houses on a particular street running from west to east.

We keep the row constant by prepending only the row by a $, for example A$1.

TASK
Fill in E2:E11, the area relative to the world land area as percentage. Try to do this first by selecting column D2:D11, and copying it one column to the right by dragging from the lower right corner.
Apparently, the values can't just be copied. You can solve this by locking only the row in D2 and copy that to D11. Then copy D2:D11 to column E again.
