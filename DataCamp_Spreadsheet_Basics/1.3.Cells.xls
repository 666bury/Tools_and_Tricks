If you're having a hard time telling apart rows from columns, a little trick that can help is to think of the spreadsheet as a theater, with the stage on the left. Your position relative to the stage is defined by a letter: A, B, C, etc. Your position within the row is defined with a number: 1, 2, 3, etc.

Each indivisible rectangle you see in the spreadsheet is called a cell. Each cell has a value (like Flour) and a position. The position is defined by the combination of its column and its row. We call this combination a cell address.

The address of a cell is defined by the column letter, followed by the row number. For example, the cell highlighted in the following image is B3: column B and row 3.


TASK

Change the cost of butter to $2.50. First, you should select the cell with address E4. Change the value of this cell to $2.50.
Reminder: hit the Enter key to finish editing the last cell before clicking 'Check Answer'
