Let's go one step further. In the previous exercises we talked about rows, columns, cells and their addresses. Often in spreadsheets, we'll talk about ranges.

A range is a rectangular group of cells. We define ranges from the top left to the bottom right. A range is defined by two cell addresses, divided by a colon (:). The value left of : will be the address of the top left cell. The value on the right of : will be the bottom right.

For example, A1:B2 will be the range that goes from A1 in the top left, to B2 in the bottom right. Like this:


Ranges don't have to stretch over multiple columns or rows. They can be a single column or row.

TASK
In the range B2:C3, change the values to: 130, 200, 135, 500. These values are defined from top left to bottom right, left to right, top to bottom.
In the range E4:E5 change the dollar amounts to: $2.50, $0.25. These values are defined from top to bottom.
