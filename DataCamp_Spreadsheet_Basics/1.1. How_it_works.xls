Welcome to the course on Google Sheets! In this course, you'll work with data coming in spreadsheets. You can edit the spreadsheet on the right in order to complete the exercises. When you hit 'Check Answer', your work is evaluated and you get feedback based on your solution.

Always make sure you finished entering your solution into the spreadsheet before you click 'Check Answer'. You can ensure this by hitting the Enter key.

Have a look at the data you find filled in in the spreadsheet. You'll find a list of items you need to bake some cookies. It includes information like weight, calories, expiration date and price.

Feel free to have a look around. When you're ready to start the exercises, simply hit 'Check Answer'.
