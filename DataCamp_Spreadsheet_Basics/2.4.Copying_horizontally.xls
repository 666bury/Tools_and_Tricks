Just like you can copy cells vertically, you can just as well copy cells horizontally. Once again, when copying references, they will shift along. This time they will change columns.

For example, when a cell on A2 holds a reference: =A1, and you copy this cell to B2, the reference will be copied as =B1.

TASK
In D2, fill in a reference to B2. Remember to start the formula with a =.
In D3, fill in a reference to B3. Of course, feel free to use any tricks you've learned before.
Copy D2 to E2 by dragging the cell to the right.
Next, copy D3 to E3 by dragging the cell to the right. Click on E3 to check what's filled in automatically.
