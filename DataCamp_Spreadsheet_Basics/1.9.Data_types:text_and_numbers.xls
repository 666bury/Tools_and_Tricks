You might've felt filling in a lot of values felt tedious at some points, but we'll learn some neat tricks in the next chapter that will increase your productivity.

For the remainder of this chapter, we're going to discuss data types. Each cell value in Google Sheets has a type. In the data we've seen: text, number, date, currency and logical. Let's look at two:

text: plain text, will be used if there's no other type recognized. You can force this with ', e.g.: 'text, or '2. Aligned to the left by default.
numbers: if you enter numbers (without using '), they will automatically have this type. Aligned to the right by default.
Alignment reflects the placement of text in a cell. This picture explains it all:

TASK
Let's do something silly! In A2 change the value by a formula, starting with = as always. Now write "Eggs", those quotes are important. Then add 1 to it using the + operator. The cell will contain a #VALUE! error, meaning the value could not be calculated. Hover over the cell to see the details. Does this error seem fair?
Fill in '= 0.40 * 21% in F2, mind the ' in front. Spaces are important here. By using the single quote, you ensure the formula will not be calculated.
