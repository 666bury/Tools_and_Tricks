Referencing becomes especially useful if you start copying the references around. When you copy formulas containing references to neighbouring cells, the references will shift along.

An example: let's say you have = A1 in the cell with address B1. If you copy this cell to B2, the reference will change to = A2.

You're going to be copying a lot of cells in the following exercises. So here's a little trick: to copy a cell to neighbouring cells, select the cell and move your mouse to the lower right corner. The cursor should change to a "+"-sign. Drag and drop to where you want to copy, as such:

TASK
In D2, fill in a formula with only a reference to C2. Remember to start with a =.
Now use the trick shown above to copy this cell below until D11. In case you're not sure how: the animation might help you get on your way. You can copy the values all the way down to D11 in one go.
