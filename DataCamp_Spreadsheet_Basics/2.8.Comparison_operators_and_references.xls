The comparison operators we discussed in the previous chapter can also be used with references.

For example, if A1 holds the value 3 and another cell has =A1 > 2, it will evaluate to the logical value TRUE.

TASK
In F2:F11, fill in a column which is TRUE each time the density is bigger than the world average and FALSE otherwise. The world average is 51.
In G2:G11, fill in a column which is TRUE each time the continent is equal to "Asia" and FALSE otherwise. To know whether something is equal to some text, you can use = ... = "some text", of course you need to fill in the .... Watch out, you need one = to start the formula and another in the middle to make the comparison.
