There's one more mathematical operator: the exponent. The exponent of a number says how many times to multiply the number by itself. For example: 5 exponent 4 means multiplying 5 by 5 by 5 by 5, or = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5. With an exponent you'd write this as = 5 ^ 4, reading "5 to the power 4".

Formulas can also have parentheses, or round brackets: ( and ). Parentheses control the order operations are calculated in. Mathematical operations are executed in the following order:

parentheses
exponents
multiplication and division
addition and subtraction.
For example: in = 1 + (2 * 3) ^ 4, Google Sheets first calculates 2 * 3 between the parentheses, then takes the result (6) to the power 4 and finally adds 1. The result is 1297.

TASK

In B2, change 121 with 11 to the power 2. You should use the ^ operator.
In B3, change 125 with 1.25 times 10 to the power 2. You should combine the * and the ^ operator here.
In B4, change 65 with 7 plus 2 to the power 2, and from this value subtract 16. Think about where to use parentheses, the result should be 65.
